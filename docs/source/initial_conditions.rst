Initial Conditions Generation
-----------------------------

The typical use of radial profiles and particle distributions created by
``cluster_generator`` will be to create initial conditions for simulations.
The :class:`~cluster_generator.ics.ClusterICs` class can be used
to set up one or more clusters in some spatial configuration, with initial
velocities, and perform other tasks to get one ready to run a single cluster
or cluster merger simulation.
