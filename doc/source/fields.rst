Generating 3D Cluster Fields
----------------------------

Most of the functionality of ``cluster_generator`` assumes spherical symmetry
for each cluster, and thus most applications can work with 1D models which can 
be mapped onto either grid cells, particles, or used of their own accord. 
However, for initializing the complex magnetic and velocity fields which exist
in clusters for use in (magneto)hydrodynamical simulations, a full 3D 
implementation is required. 

Mathematical Overview
=====================

Magnetic and velocity fields in clusters are assumed to be complex and 
turbulent. If one wants to include these fields in a simulation of a single
cluster or a merger of clusters, these will have to be computed in a
three-dimensional fashion, which is done on a uniform grid. Then, the field 
values will need to be interpolated onto the hydro cells or particles,
depending on the nature of the code in question.

A generic turbulent 3D field :math:`{\bf V}({\bf r})` can be generated by  

.. math::

  \tilde{V_x}({\bf k}) = V_1(k)[N(u_1) + iN(u_2)] \\
  \tilde{V_y}({\bf k}) = V_2(k)[N(u_3) + iN(u_4)] \\
  \tilde{V_z}({\bf k}) = V_3(k)[N(u_5) + iN(u_6)]

Magnetic fields require more special handling, due to the constraint
that :math:`\nabla \cdot {\bf B} = 0`. The field that is generated using
the above procedure in general has at least some divergence. In 
:math:`{\bf k}`-space, the zero-divergence condition corresponds to
:math:`{\bf k} \cdot {\bf \tilde{B}} = 0`, so the divergence of the field can be
removed by subtracting off the component of :math:`\tilde{\bf B}` parallel
to :math:`{\bf k}`:

.. math::

    \tilde{\bf B} := \tilde{\bf B} - \hat{\bf k}(\hat{\bf k} \cdot {\bf \tilde{B}})

This results in zero divergence (to machine precision) on the uniform grid. If the
resulting magnetic field is linearly interpolated at a later stage onto grid cells
or particles, in general this linear interpolation will not be divergence-free, but
will have a small divergence. If your MHD code implements divergence cleaning, this
may not be a substantial concern. However, for codes using constrained transport to
evolve the magnetic field on an AMR grid (e.g. FLASH, GAMER, Athena++), it is
necessary to preserve the divergence-free condition on a generic grid structure.
The best way to do this is to derive the magnetic vector potential :math:`{\bf A}`:

.. math::

    {\bf B} = \nabla \times {\bf A} \\ 
    \tilde{\bf B} = {\bf k} \times \tilde{\bf A}

Given :math:`\tilde{\bf B}`, :math:`\tilde{\bf A}` can be solved for in 
:math:`{\bf k}`-space and can then be transformed to :math:`{\bf A}`.

Mapping a Field to Particles
============================

A :class:`~cluster_generator.fields.ClusterField` object can have its field
mapped to a set of particles at given positions using the 
:meth:`~cluster_generator.fields.ClusterField.map_field_to_particles` method.
This takes as input a :class:`~cluster_generator.particles.ClusterParticles`
object, and optional arguments for the particle type and the units to set the
new particle field to:

.. code-block:: python

    # parts is a ClusterParticles object
    ptype = "gas" # the default
    units = "km/s" # the default value is the already assigned units for
                   # the field
    vfield.map_field_to_particles(parts, ptype=ptype, units=units)

Writing a Field Out to Disk
===========================

A :class:`~cluster_generator.fields.ClusterField` object can be written
to disk using the :meth:`~cluster_generator.fields.ClusterField.write_to_h5`
method. 

.. code-block:: python

    bfields.write_to_h5("bfield.h5")
