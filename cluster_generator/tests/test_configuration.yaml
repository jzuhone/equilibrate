    # tests are run. They are run in the order they are specified here.
    # This should be used when the output of a test is necessary for a later
    # test to proceed. Each entry should be a 2-tuple, with the first entry being
    # the module name and the second being the specific test name.
    - ["cluster_generator.tests.test_models","test_model"] # builds the base model.
